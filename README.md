### Research

My current interest is the deployment of learning, modeling and control onto soft 
robots that do not allow powerful computers in their payload. 
This requires rethinking our modeling, control and learning methods in order 
to deploy less memory-hungry brains on our soft robots. I build algorithms that allow 
robotic materials to perform online predictions, controls and online learning in a 
computationally restricted environment such as an off-the-shelf microcontroller to 
solve problems related to interactions with the physical environment. The ultimate 
goal of this research is to develop a network of distributed learners able to make 
local updates to their knowledge base.

### Sarah's Lab Notes:

Here I keep things that were hard to figure out for me: 
[Installing VRPN in Python3.X](https://github.com/sarahaguasvivas/sarahaguasvivas.github.io/blob/master/lab_notes/vrpn_client.md)

### Things I believe will exist in 30 years
- Organic computers, that is, logic gates made from organic matter
- VR-enabled fully-immersive language learning experiences
