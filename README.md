## Sarah Aguasvivas Manzano

Hi! I am Sarah, I am a third year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder! 

### Research Statement

I build algorithms that allow robotic materials to perform online predictions, controls and (hopefully) learning in a computationally restricted environment such as an off-the-shelf microcontroller to solve problems related to interactions with the physical environment such as terrain determination, impact source localization and so forth.
